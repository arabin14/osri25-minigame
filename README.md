This repository contains the prototyping completed during my Oberlin Summer Research Institute (OSRI) Fellowship. I am attempting to make a pixel art museum minigame as an activity for the interview study I have set out to conduct this summer. It is called Allen Run and features five characters made from museum artwork!
